# Automated Testing of https://demoqa.com Using Playwright

## Project Overview

This project is designed to automate the testing of the website [https://demoqa.com](https://demoqa.com) using the Playwright testing framework. The website contains a variety of UI elements, including forms, buttons, text boxes, dropdowns, and more, which are ideal for practicing and demonstrating automated testing techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)


Running the Tests
To run all tests, use the following command:
 ```
npx playwright test
```
Reporting
Playwright generates test reports automatically. After running the tests, you can view the report by opening the following file in your browser:

 ```
npx playwright show-report
 ```

This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up, running, and contributing to the automated testing project for the https://demoqa.com website using Playwright. Happy testing!
